                        I've seen the strengths of machine learning from the early days, and I know it will continue to race ahead. While it's a dreamy
                        thought, I hope to lead the charge or at the very least be a part of likely one of the most important events in human history.

                        As for other technologies, I see potential in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. I'm not a huge fan of the current
                        state of crypto, but I see it as a stepping stone to something much greater. 
                    </p>

                        I also enjoy my fair share of csgo and destiny 2, which I play religiously when my brain deep fries itself in trying to keep up with the latest tech trends,
                        which I see myself continuing to do so in the far, far future.

                        As I'm focusing on university work for now, I plan to start job hunting when I feel like I can properly balance everything I
                        have right now. That being said, I'm always open to internships, and I'm sure I'll be able to find some time to work on them.

                        I still have one more web page to write, but I hope I explained effectively what I enjoy and think about from day-to-day.
