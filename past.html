                        I have an awful tendency to break the unbreakable, and when I learnt that my high school blocked
                        minecraft, I couldnt resist.

                        I learnt the basics of web development when I was 15 to make a realistic looking website and tricked a teacher into whitelisting the address. 
                        Little did they know about the little proxy that ran on port 8080.

                        After satisfying my taste of blood and getting the principle to address the "concerning rise of gaming on school property",
                        I moved onto chatrooms and simple login experiments, where I discovered python and eventually machine learning.

                        Being bold, I learnt keras and dipped my toes into mnist and this weird thing called GPT2. I eventually took what I learned and
                        wrote my first ml paper for an Extension Science assignment, analysing how well feature hashing works.

                        I saw myself enjoying what I was doing and applied for Computer Science at UTS, where after a few nail biting months, I eventually
                        got into their systems!

                        Which leads to the present day; Year 2, semester one, writing this very website! I have learnt and read a lot more, following
                        facebook, google, and microsoft's research paper trails
                        I even applied to get the LLaMA weights and got accepted (even though it was leaked a couple days later).

                        I continue experimenting even to this day, my most recent work being combing vision 
                        transformers and ConvNext, but I'll leave that for my next assignment.
