                    <p>
                        I wanted my site to stand out, and in viewing several examples, I thought KSP 2's new UI
                        was a great source of inspiration. That old-ish internet theme combined with
                        the pixelated font was so aesteically pleasing to me.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        However, I saw several design conflictions. The high contrast text was great, but I felt like it was
                        a little scattered with lots of icons and numbers.
                        I took the retro style idea and tried to adapt it more to the philosophy of simplicity and for more text heavy content.

                            which is a tiled css background image of two offset pixel sized circles.

                            Used to slide the tiles into the screen via x-transforms on load in.

                            Allows for border effect on mouse hover. Takes mouse position and draws a circular radial gradient

                            Changed to fill screen and also for centering the main screen.

                            <p class="bold">- .main_logo</p>
                            Creates the style of the main text at the top of the screen through
                            the use of various box shadows.
                        </li>

                            <p class="bold">- .glow_box</p>
                            Also uses box shadows, but with a much larger blur. When combined with the solid border of each
                            tile, it gives a neon effect. Similarly for glow_text.

                            Creates the left and right borders around the tiles, centers the content to allow
                            for easier reading, and uses flexbox to wrap and stretch the tiles to fit.

                            Unicode squares and spaces are not the same width, this class ensures the qr code is
                            square. I used unicode as it allowed to easier experimentation with colors (svgs did not work for me, and 
                            I like the slight overlap effect anyways)

                        Apart from that, I was worried that the NES font may be hard to read, so I switch to courier for all text heavy boxes.

                        I used flexbox in css to adaptively allow the tiles to fit the screen, which
                        allows for a better small screen experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I also used image-rendering: pixelated for the background for a pixel art effect, which also allows
                        for faster loading as the image can be smaller.

                        I also verified my page with <a class="selectable" href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator" target="_blank">jigsaw css validator</a> with a full pass.
                        and made sure that all css selectors were supported by the browsers I was targeting with <a class="selectable" href="https://caniuse.com" target="_blank">caniuse</a>.

                        I am very happy with my design choices, a mix between the complexities of retro and the 
                        simplicities of tiles.

                        I wanted users to perceive the site as more of an art project than a wall of text, with 
                        "bits of personality" sticking though, with an emphasis on its readablity and "calmness".
                        If I were to do it again, I would place more attention on the interactive elements and a more
                        extensive background.
