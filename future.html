                        I've seen the strengths of machine learning from the early days, and I know it will continue to race ahead. While it's a dreamy
                        thought, I hope to lead the charge or at the very least be a part of likely one of the most important events in human history.
                        I am also a huge crypto advocate, but more for the open-source and research feel of it.

                        I also enjoy my fair share of csgo and destiny 2, which I play religiously when my brain deep fries itself in trying to keep up with the latest tech trends,
                        and I see myself continuing to do so in the far, far future.

                        As I'm focusing on univeristy work for now, I plan to start job hunting when I feel like I can properly balance everything I
                        have right now, from taking care of my sister's high school journey, to my own personal endevours.

                        I still have one more web page to write, but I hope I explained effectively what I enjoy and think about from day-to-day.
